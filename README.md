# Zork.py

Thank you for downloading a copy of Zork, The PY Edition!
This Python Program is based loosely on the Storyline of Zork I, and is intended to run and function exactly like the original -
the only difference being that this version is written with Python and can therefore be run and downloaded for free!

To get started:
1. Unzip/Extract the files within this folder to your computer
1. If you do not have the latest version of Python 3 installed, please install it from http://www.python.org/download
1. Open the file named "zork.py"
1. Have Fun!

**Note: This program is built to run on Python 3.**

Custom room:
The custom room in the game is south of the cave. There is nothing inside of it at the moment, it it mostly just an easter egg, however,
if I finished part C there would be a weapon that could kill the grue, and other items that would be useful in the game. It is still 
possible for the user to get kiled by the grue.
